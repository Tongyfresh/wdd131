          After a fulfilling seven-year career in the fast-paced world of
          mortgage capital markets, I've embarked on a new professional and
          educational adventure, pivoting to my passion in tech. This transition
          has been an exciting journey of growth and learning. On a personal
          note, though I've been looking for work for a little while now, my
          life is wonderfully busy with my two-year-old daughter, who keeps me
          on my toes, and I'm looking forward to celebrating my sixth wedding
          anniversary with my wife this year. It's a life full of exciting
          changes, both professionally and personally, and I wouldn't have it
          any other way.
